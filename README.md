## About:
This is my final project start2impact University. It's designed to be minimalistic and futurewise expandable. It uses Global Warmings API for graphs, in which you can find O2, NO2, Global Temperature, Global Sea Levels and Methane.
<ul> 
<li>The website welcomes you with a slideshow of the graphs mentioned above, if you want to expand your knoledge about every thematic you can find them in the Wiki section of the website.</li>

## WARNING: The Temperature API seems to work not everyday, if the graph ot Global Temperature doesn't show up please come again the next day.

## Give it a go, also works on Mobile.
